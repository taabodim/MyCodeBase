Classes you need to implement:
- AMPClickFiltersActionsService
- APIClickFiltersActionsService
- ClickFiltersActionsProcessorImpl
- ClickFiltersActionsProcessorUtils

ClickStatusGroup Dao to get FilterGroup name


https://localhost:8443/rest_services/amp/clickfilters/actions/edit/subj_rate

whenever the apply to filterGroup is involved , we don't say the old value, because its change


If click status id doesn't exist for filter id it means that the subj rate doesn't exist for that filter id . so you only need to add validation for this and you don't need to add the change part for this (done)

for other parts you need to do both validation and change for the subjection rates

take a look at filter groupings_proposed_28april in google docs , NOVEMBER 2013 UPDATES tab , to see the most updated mappings 
between the filter id and click status ids


in clickcache db , there is a table called click_status and click_Status_group and group_click_status that relates the both tables.

this is the dao imll for click status ClickStatusDetailsDAOJDBCImpl

SimpleClickStatus this is the object that model the click status

protected boolean subjRateEnabled = false;  if its true , they are allowed to change subj rate if not throw the invalid request error to the UI


Filters_V4  store info about filters
Filters_Setting_V4 store info about subjection rate ===> dao class for this is ClickFiltersActionsDAOJDBCImpl  , complete this and write update and add for this dao.

com.admarketplace.dao.clickFilters.common  has all the common dais for click status ….


just make sure that front end pass you click status id and use that to find the filter id because we store filter id 


first I have to start IM-35 then go to validation logic , IM-34



comment is mandatory , if there is no comment , throw invalid request exception

take a close look at this doc Click Filters Settings Implementation  in google docs







vertical ---> ampax   , Traffic_Source store info about traffic sources in prod

com.admarketplace.trafficsources.dao.ts.TrafficSourceDAOJdbcImpl reads traffic source from prod , its in a jar file ,  you need to get info from 
traffic sources sub1 to sub4 based on the front end id that is passed to you and save it in  Filters_Setting_V4 table …


 the filter id is found based on clickStatusId that UI will send you 

these are the parameters that UI will send you 
value: requried
comment: required
tsId: optional
clickStatusId: optional (filter ID in UI)
groupId: optional
deviceTypeId: optional
deviceGroupId: optional
pubSubTypeId: optional (implementation type ID)
thisFilterGroup: optional
allSubs: optional
asOverride: optional

once the subjection rate  they change a value, they cannot go back to empty
it means if they pass me a null subj rate and I already have an int value, I throw a invalid request ( just throw when the value is outside 0-100 range)


each time , if its a traffic source, you need to store  publisher id, sub1---sub4 and traffic source id 

if we store some request and some of the above fields are empty just store them as 0 except advertiser field , so you store it as null



those 3 options are in the Publishers View in UI only*(check boxes) we don't have that in Filter view


Filter View ===> Filter Grid, Device Type , implementation Type

Apply to this filter group:
if they pass me this, i find the click status id and get all filters ( find the dao for this in the code)

Apply to all Sub source:
  Pub level: set new subjection rate to this pub and its all existing sub1 children and Sub 4 grandchildren.
  Sub 1 level: set new subjection rate to this sub 1 and its all existing Sub 4 children.



 if they pass a request without override, check priority in db and change it back to 0



when you are throwing exception , use restValidationException …. and don't put stackTrace, make a readable error message

I can get level from the traffic source Id , then we know

commit is regarding these tasks in jira  IM-31 , IM-34 , IM-35

When you update the subjection rate for any case, if there is no traffic source  entry in db, insert instead of update.

if its a children and its not in db, don't insert and forget about it .

Traffic_SOURCE ampx table in vertical

// sub2 and sub3 are excluded from all kinds of updates in the db. if
// the traffic source entry has the level 2 or 3
// throw a validation exception
// params.getGroupId()//this is the filter group id



when you change priority to -9, only the parent priority should change
